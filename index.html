        <h1>Class</h1>
        Today I hurry off to class
        <br><br>That way I wouldn't be late
        <br><br>I look at the clock so time will pass
        <br><br>While doing my work in a focused state
        <br><br>I'm kinda bummed that I have a busy day
        <br><br> And having to walk everywhere
        <br><br>At the same time i get to see my friends and say hey
        <br><br>and seeing many familiar faces from here to there
        <br><br>Even though my day is long
        <br><br>I'm a college student at Lasalle which is where I belong
